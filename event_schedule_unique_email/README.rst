===========================
event_schedule_unique_email
===========================

There can be many email addresses duplicates on the event attendees
registrations list. When an email reminder is sent, it's going to be
duplicated for as many times such address is present.


Usage
=====

Just install. It avoids duplicate email addresses on event reminders.
